<p> Things learned : </p>
<ul>
<li>Data Selection: Consider what data is available, what data is missing and what data can be removed.</li>
<li>Data Preprocessing: Organize selected data by formatting, cleaning and sampling from it. </li>
<li>Data Transformation: Transform preprocessed data ready for machine learning by engineering features using scaling, attribute decomposition and attribute aggregation.</li>
  <li> Used numpy, matplotlib, numpy and sklearn libraries to handle, visualize and manipulate data </li>
</ul>
